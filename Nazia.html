<pre>
 During writing a proper SRS we will follow some rules. Here we will use<br>Times New Roman. Our font size will be 12.Morever we have title and also some sub title.<br>For title we will use font 14 and will bold it for better understanding.<br>Then the sub title will also be font 12 and bold for easily noticing.
</pre>
<h3>1.3	Intended Audience and Reading Suggestions</h3>
<pre>
 For establishing a full project there have to work a lots of people like developers, project managers,<br>marketing staff, users, testers, and documentation writers. They have different tasks for<br>completing a full project. A project manager handles all the project, developer<br>will develop the project where it will need, marketing staffs will publicly spread<br>the benefit of using the project, testers will tet the software after completing it,<br>documentation writers will write documents which is related with this software.<br>After doing all the task they will deliver it to  users so that they can be benefited by using this software.
</pre>
<h3>1.4	Product Scope</h3>
<pre>
People can see the able ablity of the seat in the stadium. There is a pre-booking<br> option which is helpfull for ensuring the seat. All the matches schedul will be<br>also publish in this webside.
</pre>
<h3>1.5	References</h3>
<pre>
In India there is a side where any one can book seat for movie in the cinema hall, matches seat for games and sports. that web side name is <a href="https://in.bookmyshow.com/sports">Book My Show</a>

<section id="Other Nonfunctional Requirements">
	<h2>5.	Other Nonfunctional Requirements</h2>
	<div>
		<h3>5.1	Performance Requirements</h3>
		<pre>
 The only way in which systems will meet their performance targets is for them to be<br> specified clearly and unambiguously. In many cases performance requirements are never<br> ridged as system that does not fully meet its defined performance requirements may<br>still be released as other consideration such as time to market.<br>
 In order to assess the performance of a system the following must be clearly specified:<br>
• Response Time<br>
• Workload<br>
• Scalability<br>
• Platform<br>

		</pre>
		<h3>5.2	Safety Requirements</h3>
		<pre>
 Internet safety is a must-have while you are doing something on the Web.<br>To be secure online, you must use some techniques so that you can be protected from scammers,<br>viruses, and predators. If you do not take proper precautions, then you would be at risk.<br>First of all, if you are using Windows, then you have to download Internet security<br>software. As a result of having this kind of security, viruses and hackers would be blocked.<br>However, make sure that you receive regular security updates from the provider.<br>
Next, beware of online scammers. For instance, there are scammers who promise you<br>will become rich in a short span of time, but you have to invest a certain amount first.<br>Another scam is perpetrated through an e-mail informing you that you have a dying relative<br>who needs financial support and so on. To avoid being cheated, never give out your credit card information<br> and bank account numbers. In case you have to make online purchases, sign up for an<br> account only with reliable and reputable websites.

		<h3>5.3 Security Requirement</h3>
		<pre>
 No matter how big your company is or what it does,security is<br>a primary consideration when choosing a Web service for all applications.<br>The key Web services security requirements are given below:<br>
1.	Authentication<br>
2.	Authorization<br>
3.	Data Protection<br>
4.	Non repudiation<br>

		</pre>
<h3>Software Quality Attributes</h3>
	<pre>
		<ul>
  <li>Maintainability</li>
  <pre>
  Maintainability is the ability of the system to undergo changes with a degree of ease. 
  These changes could impact components, services, features, and interfaces when adding 
  or changing the functionality, fixing errors, and meeting new business requirements.</pre>
  <li>Reusability</li>
  <pre>
  Reusability defines the capability for components and subsystems to be suitable for use in 
  other applications and in other scenarios. Reusability minimizes the duplication of 
  components and also the implementation time.</pre>
  
  <li>Runtime Quality</li>
  <pre>
  
  Availability defines the proportion of time that the system is functional and working. 
  It can be measured as a percentage of the total system downtime over a predefined period. 
  Availability will be affected by system errors, infrastructure problems, malicious attacks, and system load.</pre>
  
  <li>Interoperability</li>
  <pre>
  Interoperability is the ability of a system or different systems to operate successfully by 
  communicating and exchanging information with other external systems written and run by external 
  parties. An interoperable system makes it easier to exchange and reuse information internally as well as externally.</pre>
  <li>Manageability</li>
  <pre>
  Manageability defines how easy it is for system administrators to manage the application, usually 
  through sufficient and useful instrumentation exposed for use in monitoring systems and for 
  debugging and performance tuning.</pre>
  <li>Performance</li>
  <pre>
  Performance is an indication of the responsiveness of a system to execute any action within a 
  given time interval. It can be measured in terms of latency or throughput. Latency is the time 
  taken to respond to any event. Throughput is the number of events that take place within a given amount of time.</pre>
  <li>Reliability</li>
  <pre>
  Reliability is the ability of a system to remain operational over time. Reliability is measured as 
  the probability that a system will not fail to perform its intended functions over a specified time interval.</pre>
  <li>Scalability</li>
  <pre>
  Scalability is ability of a system to either handle increases in load without impact on
the performance of the system, or the ability to be readily enlarged.</pre>

</ul>

		<h3>5.5	Business Rules</h3>
		<pre>
 Business Rules also give you the criteria and conditions for making these decisions.<br>0After making this website we have to follow some rules for better<br>market value which is business rules.If our website is helpful<br>for general people business profit will be increased.
