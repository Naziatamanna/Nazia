<h2>1.	Introduction</h2>
This project is web-based system. Online stadium ticket reservation system is basically<br> made for providing the customers with adequate service, anywhere and anytime.<br> This system creates a huge relief for the football fans. This system provides help to the user as they can<br> inquire about seat, its ticket price, available seats,<br> about upcoming events, date and time as well etc. They don’t need to walk to the stadium for their reservation purpose.<br> For building this software properly we need some design specification. In SDS we are discussing those<br> which are given below.

<h1>1.1Purpose of this document</h1>
Before starting this task we have selected some purposes .And we have a goal, objective and motivation.The main objective of this<br> SDS document is to understand and illustrate to the general public about this software.We have prepared a software design specification so that people<br> can easily understand about using of this software.Here we will use HTML, CSS,PHP,Java Script and so on.We have also use Laravel as<br> a frame work.The language we will use to build our software which is very popular to us now a days.We think that those languages are able to make<br> an excellent software which will encourage the general people to utilize this software.

<h1>1.2 Scope of the development project</h1>
  In our project we will use some languages like HTML,CSS,PHP,JAVA SCRIPT etc. Here’s are some description  about those:<br>
<b>HTML :</b>The Hypertext Markup Language is used  for describing the structure and  it is presented  of information via the Internet<br> HTML are displayed on the World Wide Web.<br>
<b>CSS :</b> is used  for describing the presentation of Web pages, including colors, layout, and fonts. It can defines large screens,<br> small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of HTML .<br>
<b>PHP:</b>  is a general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited to server-side web development, in which case PHP generally runs on a web server. <br>
<b>JavaScript: </b> is a CS (Client Side) scripting language. It is in no way related to Java as it's name suggests,<br> but it is used for client side scripting. By Client Side scripting, i mean the ability to manipulate data<br>
We will use those languages because those languages are totally perfect to make a successful project. Those are used for making a<br> colorful ,easy and understandable website so that public can easily use this website. If it might easy to use and<br> interesting we think that it will enlarge the stadium business.
